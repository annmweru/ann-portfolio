        Both pairs of <span className='font-bold text-white'>phrases are perfectly acceptable.</span> Which to choose depends on context. "Who is this" or 
        "Who is that" makes sense when you can refer to the person (perhaps by pointing to them in a photograph,
         or referring back to <span className='font-bold text-white'> something someone just said, though the reference </span>could be implicit, too) whereas "who is he" or "who is she" doesn't require that sort of frame of reference.
